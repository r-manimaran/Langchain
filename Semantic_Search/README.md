# Perform Similarity Search using Langchain, Vector Database
### Similarity Search:
Similarity search is a technique used to identify items in a dataset that are similar to a given query item. This process typically involves measuring the distance or similarity between data points using various metrics, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. It is widely used in applications like recommendation systems, image retrieval, and text analysis.

### Similarity Search with Metadata filtering:
This approach enhances similarity search by incorporating metadata filtering, which allows users to refine search results based on additional attributes or descriptors associated with the data. By applying filters based on metadata (like date, author, or category), users can retrieve more relevant results that meet specific criteria alongside the similarity measures.

### Similarity Search with Document Summaries:
In this context, similarity search is augmented with document summarization techniques. After retrieving similar documents, concise summaries are generated to provide users with quick insights into the content of each document. This enables users to assess relevance without needing to read entire documents, improving the efficiency of information retrieval.

### Similarity Search with Re-Ranking:
ReRanking is a technique used to refine the order of search results after the initial retrieval process. In similarity search, this involves reassessing the relevance of the results based on additional criteria or user feedback, such as contextual information or user behavior. This ensures that the most relevant results appear at the top of the list, enhancing the overall search experience.
