       "[Document(metadata={'source': './technical.txt'}, page_content=\".Net & .Net Core Web API:\\n.NET Framework vs .NET Core: .NET Core is cross-platform, open-source, and optimized for microservices and high-performance applications.\\nDependency Injection (DI): Built-in DI in .NET Core simplifies testability and decouples components.\\nMiddleware: Custom middleware in .NET Core is used to handle HTTP requests and responses.\\nVersioning in Web API: Best practices for versioning APIs include URL path versioning, query string versioning, and header versioning.\\nAsynchronous Programming: Use of async/await for non-blocking I/O operations to enhance performance.\\n\\n\\nFastAPI:\\nFastAPI Core Strengths: High performance, type hints for request validation, and auto-generated OpenAPI documentation.\\nDependency Injection in FastAPI: Simplifies code testing and component decoupling.\\nData Validation: Use Pydantic for automatic request body validation, type checking, and schema generation.\\nConcurrency: Handles requests asynchronously using Python's asyncio for fast API responses.\\nSecurity Features: OAuth2, JWT token-based authentication.\\n\\n\\nGenerative AI:\\nTransformer Models: Understanding of architectures like GPT, BERT for natural language processing tasks.\\nModel Training: Fine-tuning large models (like GPT or BERT) for specific tasks such as text generation, classification.\\nText-to-Image Models: Use of diffusion models or GANs for text-to-image tasks.\\nCommon Libraries: HuggingFace, TensorFlow, PyTorch for model development and deployment.\\nPrompt Engineering: Optimizing prompts for generative AI models for more accurate and efficient output.\\n\\nAWS Services:\\nEC2: Compute instances with auto-scaling and load balancing.\\nLambda: Serverless architecture for running code without provisioning or managing servers.\\nS3: Object storage service, handling file storage with high availability.\\nAPI Gateway: Manages APIs with caching, throttling, and security.\\nRDS/ DynamoDB: RDS for relational databases and DynamoDB for NoSQL databases.\\nCloudFormation/Terraform: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automating AWS resource provisioning.\\n\\nAzure Services:\\nApp Services: Managed hosting for web applications, REST APIs with scaling and deployment capabilities.\\nAzure Functions: Serverless computing for event-driven applications.\\nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Container orchestration and deployment of Docker-based applications.\\nAzure Blob Storage: Object storage for unstructured data with replication and geo-redundancy.\\nAzure Active Directory: Identity and access management (IAM) for secure authentication across services.\\nCosmosDB: Globally distributed, low-latency NoSQL database for scalable applications.\\n\\nOpenID Connect (OIDC):\\nOIDC Overview: OIDC is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 for authentication.\\nFunctionality: It allows clients (like web/mobile apps) to verify the identity of end-users based on authentication performed by an authorization server.\\nFlow: Uses tokens like ID Tokens, which are JWTs containing claims about the user (name, email, etc.) and Access Tokens for API access.\\nCommon Use Cases: Single Sign-On (SSO), securing web APIs, and federated identity.\\nOIDC Providers: Key providers include Azure AD, Google Identity, Okta, and Auth0.\\n\\nForgeRock:\\nForgeRock Overview: A comprehensive, enterprise-grade digital identity platform.\\nCore Products: Includes Identity Management (IDM), Access Management (AM), Identity Gateway (IG), and Directory Services (DS).\\nKey Features:\\nIdentity Management: Provisioning and lifecycle management of user identities.\\nAccess Management: Authentication, authorization, single sign-on (SSO), and MFA.\\nAdaptive Authentication: Allows context-based authentication (location, behavior).\\nIntegrations: Works well with OIDC, OAuth2, SAML, and provides fine-grained access control.\\n\\nPing Access:\\nPing Access Overview: A centralized web and API access security gateway.\\nCore Features:\\nWeb and API Security: Provides secure access to both web applications and APIs.\\nFine-Grained Access Control: Offers policy-based access control for APIs and web resources.\\nSSO & MFA: Integrates with PingFederate for seamless SSO and multi-factor authentication (MFA).\\nOAuth 2.0 and OIDC Integration: Can act as a policy enforcement point for OAuth 2.0 resource servers.\\nCommon Use Cases: API security, securing microservices, and centralized access control for enterprise applications.\\n\\nSerilog:\\nSerilog Overview: A structured logging library for .NET applications.\\nKey Features:\\nStructured Logging: Logs are stored in structured formats (e.g., JSON) for better queryability.\\nLog Sinks: Supports various destinations for logs such as files, Seq, databases, and cloud platforms like Elasticsearch.\\nEnrichers: Adds additional context to logs such as machine names, thread IDs, and more.\\nIntegration: Integrates well with ASP.NET Core for capturing logs across the app lifecycle.\\n\\nPrometheus:\\nPrometheus Overview: A monitoring and alerting toolkit primarily for cloud-native, containerized applications.\\nKey Features:\\nTime-Series Database: Stores metrics with timestamps and allows efficient querying.\\nPull-Based Model: Prometheus scrapes metrics from targets (applications, services) at regular intervals.\\nPromQL: Powerful query language to retrieve and manipulate metrics data.\\nAlertManager: Allows configuration of alert rules based on metrics and sends notifications (Slack, email, etc.).\\nCommon Use Cases: Monitoring system performance, tracking application metrics, and setting up alerting thresholds.\\n\\nGrafana:\\nGrafana Overview: An open-source platform for visualizing metrics and analytics from various data sources.\\nKey Features:\\nMulti-Source Data Visualization: Supports multiple data sources, including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, MySQL, and more.\\nCustom Dashboards: Create real-time, interactive dashboards to visualize time-series metrics.\\nAlerting: Can set up alert rules based on metric thresholds and send notifications.\\nPanel Plugins: Extensible with plugins for more complex visualizations (graphs, heatmaps, geomaps, etc.).\\nCommon Use Cases: Visualizing infrastructure metrics, application performance, and real-time monitoring.\\n\\nSeq:\\nSeq Overview: A centralized logging server for structured log data, commonly used with Serilog.\\nKey Features:\\nLog Aggregation: Collects logs from multiple applications and allows searching, filtering, and correlation of logs.\\nStructured Logs: Stores logs in structured formats for improved searchability and analytics.\\nAlerting and Notifications: Allows setting up alerts on specific log patterns or error conditions.\\nIntegration: Works seamlessly with Serilog, ASP.NET, and other .NET logging libraries.\\nCommon Use Cases: Centralized logging platform for .NET applications, debugging, and tracking issues in production environments.\")]"
